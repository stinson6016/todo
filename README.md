bored weekend project

found todo tutorial and took ideas from that and remade it to make it more complex for no reason other then to kill time. setup to run as a windows service on my laptop, just because.

flask back end using sqlite and bootstrap to make to front end look "nice". code template and layout pulled from my other projects. first project to use sqlite for the database, could not get migrate to work but didn't try very hard.

example used for inspiration
